<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>Welcome to My Awesome Company.</p>
<p>
Captain gizzard:
A decommissioned grunt bot same type as was (also ver different generations hes a bit old) <a href="index.html">Bastion</a> but not a specialized electric unit like her. He owns the facility that Bastion works at, he has Bastions code until she gets transferred to kar - who also works there but doesn't live on site unlike a lot of the employees. (the facility is like a mix of a mechanicâ€™s garage and fire station in vibe). Captain Gizzard fully owns this facility yet offloads a lot of work hiring and accounting work onto people he hires. He is still the main person who manages higher paying jobs. Captain Gizzard recognizes that she has parts from an electric specialized grunt bot but doesnt think that she once was one, also recognizes that she is a maid bot and mainly addresses her as that. He is pretty humours but stern and pretty easy going as long it doesn't ruin a turn out for a payment - will allow hired people to use whatever weapons they like (but Bastion  over uses the particle cannon so she has some restrictions isn't very cost efficient).    positions on the military- <a href="index.html">bastions</a>. wants to get away from it and live her own life while blight actually liked the lifestyle but can never return to it </p>
